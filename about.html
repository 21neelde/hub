<p> Hi, my name is Evan Neeld. Some of my favorite things include video games, getting good grades, and helping others. I go to Bordentown Regional High School, one that provides a lot of opportunities for me.</p>
<p> Outside of school, I am active in the Super Smash Bros. competitive scene, and I go to tournaments for it once a week. I am also in TSA, or the Technology Student Association.</p>
