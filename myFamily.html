<h1> My family: </h1>
<img src="family.jfif" alt="stick figure family", width="500", height="300">
<p> This is my family. As you can see, we are made of stick figures and are not like other normal human beings. We do not breathe, eat, or drink. This is why we are so cool! </p>
<h3> My Dog </h3>
<img src="Yorkshire-Terrier-Puppy.jpg">
<p> This is my dog, Dr. Dogball. He is very good at dodgeball and has won many national tournaments competing with normal humans over the years. He also screams whenever he hears any sound at all.
<h3> My Mom </h3>
<img src="mom.jfif", width="500", height="400">
<p> This is my mom, Unown. Despite her name, Unown is a famous chicken nugget scientist, winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 5 B.C. </p>
<h3> My Dad </h3>
<img src="dad.jpg", width="500", height="600">
<p> This is my dad, the wonderful Dr. Dodgeball himself. Dr. Dodgeball is rather bad at dodgeball, but he was also brought up by Danny Death, a childhood friend who served as a parental figure for him later in life. Dr. Dodgeball would eventually kill Danny Death, however, due to a dodgeball "incident". </p>
<h3> My Brother and I </h3>
<img src="kids.jfif", width="500", height="400">
<p> This is my brother and I playing Fortnite online with TheBest123 online. I am very into video games and getting good grades, as is my brother as we are exact clones.
