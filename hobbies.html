	<h1> My top 3 Hobbies </h1>
	
	<ol>
	
	<li> Watching Youtube </li>
	<p> My best way of relaxing after school typically lies in the great informative website of Youtube. On this website, I watch educational videos about facts, history and science that range from being absolutely useless to me from helping me understand more of the inner workings of our world. </p>

	<li> Video Games </li>
	<p> When I'm motivated, I will usually play a video game in my free time, as of late mostly Fortnite for fun and Super Smash Bros. to improve myself at the game. I care about my skill at this game because one of the things I go to outside of school happens to be tournaments for the game. </p>

	<li> Editing Videos </li>
	<p> Occasionally, I will be in the mood to create something, and I normally use this mood to create and edit videos. These are typically combo videos for the competitive game I play, but I also sometimes upload videos meant to be funny or involved with a different game.  </p>
